sample csv data is structured using pandas into dataframes and size of data is measured

Label Encoding

categorical columns converted to numerical ones
spam category valued as zero whereas ham as 1

Feature Extraction

Model Training and Evaluation 

logistic regression model is trained and then evaluated using the accuracy score

prediction on new data

prediction is made using the input data and if it is 1 then ham mail else spam mail is
categorised

RESULT



![spam email](https://github.com/IshitaSuchdeva/spam-email-detection/assets/91798812/31a326d6-a57b-446b-b575-19f3224e4199)
